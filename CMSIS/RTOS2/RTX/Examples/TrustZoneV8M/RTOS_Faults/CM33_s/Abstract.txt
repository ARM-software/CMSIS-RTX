This ARM Cortex-M33 RTOS_Faults example project shows 
how the ARMv8-M architecture reacts to potential 
security attacks.

To execute a test case enter in the uVision Debugger command window
>TestCase=<n>   <n> is a test case number

After execution of a test case, the security attack gets
recorded in the IncidentLog and the application gets reset.
The struct IncidentLogCopy can be viewed in a watch window
and shows the past four recorded incidents.
