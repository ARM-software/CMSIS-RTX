\brief Define, create, and control thread functions.
\details 
The Thread Management function group allows defining, creating, and controlling thread functions in the system. The function
\b main is a special thread function that is started at system initialization and has the initial priority
\a osPriorityNormal.


\anchor ThreadStates
Threads can be in the following states:

 - \b RUNNING: The thread that is currently running is in the \b RUNNING state. Only one thread at a time can be in this state.

 - \b READY: Threads which are ready to run are in the \b READY state. Once the \b RUNNING thread has terminated, or is \b BLOCKED, the next \b READY thread with the highest priority becomes the \b RUNNING thread.
 
 - \b BLOCKED: Threads that are blocked either delayed, waiting for an event to occur or suspended are in the \b BLOCKED state.
 
 - \b TERMINATED: When \ref osThreadTerminate is called, and threads that joined are in \b TERMINATED state. When all joined threads have terminated, resources are released an the threads are in state \b INACTIVE. 
 
 - \b INACTIVE: Threads that are not created or have been terminated with all resources released are in the \b INACTIVE state.
 
\image html "ThreadStatus.png" "Thread State and State Transitions"


A CMSIS-RTOS assumes that threads are scheduled as shown in the figure <b>Thread State and State Transitions</b>. The thread
states change as follows:
 - A thread is created using the function \ref osThreadNew. This puts the thread into the \b READY or \b RUNNING state
   (depending on the thread priority).
 - CMSIS-RTOS is pre-emptive. The active thread with the highest priority becomes the \b RUNNING thread provided it does not
   wait for any event. The initial priority of a thread is defined with the \ref osThreadAttr_t but may be changed during
   execution using the function \ref osThreadSetPriority.
 - The \b RUNNING thread transfers into the \b BLOCKED state when it is delayed, waiting for an event or suspended.
 - Active threads can be terminated any time using the function \ref osThreadTerminate. Threads can terminate also by just
   returning from the thread function. Threads that are terminated are in the \b INACTIVE state and typically do not consume
   any dynamic memory resources. 

\todo MH: examples with control block memory and size supplied.

By using sizeof on the object control block.

For example RTX5 has the following internal defines (starting with os_ which is not RTOS prefix but rather RTX implementation prefix):
/// Control Block sizes
\#define os_ThreadCbSize         sizeof(os_thread_t)
\#define os_TimerCbSize          sizeof(os_timer_t)
\#define os_EventFlagsCbSize     sizeof(os_event_flags_t)
\#define os_MutexCbSize          sizeof(os_mutex_t)
\#define os_SemaphoreCbSize      sizeof(os_semaphore_t)
\#define os_MemoryPoolCbSize     sizeof(os_memory_pool_t)
\#define os_MessageQueueCbSize   sizeof(os_message_queue_t)

/**
\enum osPriority_t
\details

The \b osPriority_t value specifies the priority for a thread. The default thread priority should be \a osPriorityNormal.
If a Thread is active that has a higher priority than the currently executing thread, then a thread switch occurs immediately
to execute the new task.

To prevent from a priority inversion, a CMSIS-RTOS compliant OS may optionally implement a <b>priority inheritance</b> method.
A priority inversion occurs when a high priority thread is waiting for a resource or event that is controlled by a thread
with a lower priority.

Start a thread function by adding it to the Active Threads list and set it to state \b READY. Arguments for the thread function are passed
using the parameter pointer \em *argument. When the priority of the created thread function is higher than the current \b RUNNING thread, 
the created thread function starts instantly and becomes the new \b RUNNING thread. Thread attributes are defined with the parameter pointer \em attr.
Attributes include settings for thread priority, stack size, or memory allocation.
