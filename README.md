## Generating Software Pack

Some helper scripts are provided to generate the release artifacts from this repository.

### Doxygen Documentation

Generating the HTML-formatted documentation from its Doxygen-based source is done via

```bash
CMSIS-RTX $ ./CMSIS/DoxyGen/gen_doc.sh
```

After generating the documentation, one can check the html output for broken links:

```bash
CMSIS-RTX $ ./CMSIS/DoxyGen/check_links.sh
```

Prerequisites for these scripts to succeed are:

- Doxygen 1.9.6
- Python 3.9 or later with linkchecker package installed
  `pip install linkchecker`

### CMSIS-Pack Bundle

The CMSIS-Pack bundle can be generated with

```bash
CMSIS-RTX $ ./gen_pack.sh
```

Prerequisites for this script to succeed are:

- Generated documentation (see above)
- 7z
- packchk
- xmllint (optional)

### Version and Changelog Inference

The version and changelog embedded into the documentation and pack are inferred from the
local Git history. In order to get the full changelog one needs to have a full clone (not
a shallow one) including all release tags.

The version numbers are taken from the available annotated tags. The shown release dates and
changelogs are the tagger date and the associated message is.
